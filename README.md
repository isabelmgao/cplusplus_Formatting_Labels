# cplusplus_Formatting_Labels
This program creates package labels with different formatting depending on input specifications
Created by Isabel Gao  on 3/11/15


This program reads from an input of addresses and outputs formatted addressed based on the print selection classifications 
(either 1, 2, or 3). For every address the program echos the data and depending on the selection will either output one of 
the following combinations:
1: prints address without formatting
2: prints the package label format
3: prints the address without formatting AND in package label format

Any other print selection will result in an invalid selection.
